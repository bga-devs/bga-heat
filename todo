Other :

Backend :
  
  - planification : shouldnt be able to select heat (unless very rare case where you can play nothing) => moved to back, as front makes _private.cards selectable, and heat is in the least (player colored heat at least)
  - should we send cellId for React and other questions to move cars ? So I can highlight the cell like I just did for Speed state.

Frontend :
  - card images for upgrades

  - payHeatsForCorner notif
  - payHeats notif (for heated boost for instance)
   => maybe these two notifs can be merged ? Unless you want to add a red circle around the corner for instance for the payHeatsForCorner notif ? that could be cool
  - spinOut notif
   => also very similar but also contains the new cell and the additional stress cards drawn

  - gear are buggy: not colored anymore

  - error on notif reveal
  - reveal : handle when args.heat != null

  - display discard
  - display number of cards left in deck
  
  - make speed counter work => updates when notif reveal, with sum of cards.speed. I need to check what can change this counter, probably reacts ? Maybe clean it at notif clearPlayedCards ?

  - move car animation : follow path sent by backend in notif
   => a reaaaaaally cool plus would be to have the log entries hoverable and you would get the path drawing display on hover (like the white path I had on my little animation test)

  - user pref : voir seulement le haut des cartes en main => garder environ 1/6 de la hauteur et mettre le plateau joueur par dessus, permet d'avoir une vue globale plus complÃ¨te

  - zoom icons are gone => No they are just under the map, as the map now autoscale like in TTR

  - finishTurn notif: every time someone cross the ending lane
    (to test on USA, just set cell 833 for a constructor for instance to be right before finish line)
    replace "${finishIcon}" by the finish line icon used in player panels

  - finishRace notif 
    => carCell of constructor is now negative !
     -X means the constructor finished race at position X

  - add ignore flag on public notif for drawing cards

  - "Set gear to x anD play selected card" (missing the "d")
