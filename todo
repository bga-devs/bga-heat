Other :

Backend :
  
  - planification : shouldnt be able to select heat (unless very rare case where you can play nothing) => moved to back, as front makes _private.cards selectable, and heat is in the least (player colored heat at least)
  - should we send cellId for React and other questions to move cars ? So I can highlight the cell like I just did for Speed state.

  - updateTurnOrder notif : send constructor ids (by order of play ? or with an associated "no") instead of just constructor_names. I tried to add `constructor_ids` as an array, as I think it's sorted. Is it OK ? => OK

Frontend :
  - payHeatsForCorner notif
  - payHeats notif (for heated boost for instance)
   => maybe these two notifs can be merged ? Unless you want to add a red circle around the corner for instance for the payHeatsForCorner notif ? that could be cool

  - reveal : handle when args.heat != null

  - display discard
  - display number of cards left in deck
  
  - make speed counter work

  - react state : buttons are buggy => multiple call to server

  - icons for react :
    * Cooldown
    * Adrenaline : +1 SPEED (I know adrenaline effect is actually 1 extra cooldown + 1 speed but the "+1 speed" does not have any name whereas cooldown has, so I am using 'adrenaline' to refer to the "+1 speed" thingy)
    * Heated-boost : HEAT > +

  - cooldown notif

  - user pref : voir seulement le haut des cartes en main => garder environ 1/6 de la hauteur et mettre le plateau joueur par dessus, permet d'avoir une vue globale plus complÃ¨te

  - zoom icons are gone ??
