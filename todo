Other :

Backend : 
  - planification : shouldnt be able to select heat (unless very rare case where you can play nothing) => moved to back, as front makes _private.cards selectable, and heat is in the least (player colored heat at least)
  - should we send cellId for React and other questions to move cars ? So I can highlight the cell like I just did for Speed state.
  - make corners x & y in circuitDatas to their real value instead of always 0
  - add number of cell between before and after spinOut in spinOut notif
  - change card ids & types to numbers instead of strings ?

Frontend :
  - car animation : adjust a bit end of animation to make sure car rotation is lined up with the cell (slightly off when the last move of the car is a change of lane)
  
  - legends : 
      * add fake player's panel
      * newLegendCard notif

  - notifications are too fast
  - resolveBoost: cards are not added on "played cards"

  - scrapCards notif: flipping card from deck to discard

  - "reduce stress" icon for React
  - discard notif : public discard if 'cards' is set up, eg for "reduce stress" effect the stress cards are public
    => now that I am thinking about it, maybe the last card when discarding should also be public to update discard display, no ?

  - tooltips for upgrades

  - display discard
  
  - make speed counter work => updates when notif reveal, with sum of cards.speed. I need to check what can change this counter, probably reacts ? Maybe clean it at notif clearPlayedCards ?

  - move car animation : => a reaaaaaally cool plus would be to have the log entries hoverable and you would get the path drawing display on hover (like the white path I had on my little animation test)

  - user pref : voir seulement le haut des cartes en main => garder environ 1/6 de la hauteur et mettre le plateau joueur par dessus, permet d'avoir une vue globale plus complÃ¨te

  - zoom icons are gone => No they are just under the map, as the map now autoscale like in TTR

  - find a font simir to BetterFaster-Italic for card text
