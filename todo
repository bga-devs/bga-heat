  - Cluttered hand: waiting for an answer from DoW about that.
    How can we compute "valid cards to play" ? Should we take into account the cooldown the the car may get if it lands in a sector with a weather token ?
    Can a player make a bet using stress by hoping to land in such sector ?
    
Backend : 

Frontend :
  - notif scores also contains order

  - error when moving 0 space ahead

  remove buttons when notifications are in titlebar

  - planification : highlight already selected cards (also on refresh), you have a parameter in the args :       
      'selection' => $planification[$pId] ?? null,

  -   public function clearPlayedCards($constructor, $cardIds, $sponsorIds) => new field 'sponsorIds', cards should be destroyed or something
  => maybe we need to display a sponsor deck/discard somewhere 

  - upload form: only allow .heat files

  - championship: new field received in getAllDatas
    'event' => id of the event card (following sprite in img/) 
      => you have the names of events around line 400 in Notifications.php and also the relevant information about events in constants.inc.php
      => display a press icon on the correct corner

  - refresh : display the name of the card (only if several refresh ?) => maybe with the same formatting as accelerate
  - for accelerate/refresh => make the card clickable ?
  
  - move car animation : => a reaaaaaally cool plus would be to have the log entries hoverable and you would get the path drawing display on hover (like the white path I had on my little animation test)

  - user pref : voir seulement le haut des cartes en main => garder environ 1/6 de la hauteur et mettre le plateau joueur par dessus, permet d'avoir une vue globale plus complÃ¨te

  - zoom icons are gone => No they are just under the map, as the map now autoscale like in TTR

  - find a font simir to BetterFaster-Italic for card text
