Other :

Backend : 
  - planification : shouldnt be able to select heat (unless very rare case where you can play nothing) => moved to back, as front makes _private.cards selectable, and heat is in the least (player colored heat at least)
  - should we send cellId for React and other questions to move cars ? So I can highlight the cell like I just did for Speed state.
  - make last card of a discard notif always visible ?
  - when using Refresh reaction, skip other reaction. And make sure there is no mandatory reaction pending.
  - skip salvage (with logs) if empty discard

Frontend :
  - state confirm race results 
  - notif car positions + weather
  - notif scores also contains order

  - error when finishing the race :
  Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: can't convert undefined to object
    notif_endOfRace

  - error when moving 0 space ahead

  remove buttons when notifications are in titlebar

  - planification : highlight already selected cards (also on refresh), you have a parameter in the args :       
      'selection' => $planification[$pId] ?? null,

  -   public function clearPlayedCards($constructor, $cardIds, $sponsorIds) => new field 'sponsorIds', cards should be destroyed or something
  => maybe we need to display a sponsor deck/discard somewhere 

  - loadCircuit notif : circuit field should replace gamedatas.circuit
  - jpgUrl : dont add gamethemeurl prefix if it's a custom circuit
  - upload form: only allow .heat files

  - championship: new field received in getAllDatas
    'index' => represents which circuits we are playing in the list of circuit
    'event' => id of the event card (following sprite in img/) 
      => you have the names of events around line 400 in Notifications.php and also the relevant information about events in constants.inc.php
      => display a press icon on the correct corner

  - refresh : display the name of the card (only if several refresh ?) => maybe with the same formatting as accelerate
  - for accelerate/refresh => make the card clickable ?
  
  - move car animation : => a reaaaaaally cool plus would be to have the log entries hoverable and you would get the path drawing display on hover (like the white path I had on my little animation test)

  - user pref : voir seulement le haut des cartes en main => garder environ 1/6 de la hauteur et mettre le plateau joueur par dessus, permet d'avoir une vue globale plus complÃ¨te

  - zoom icons are gone => No they are just under the map, as the map now autoscale like in TTR

  - find a font simir to BetterFaster-Italic for card text
