Other :

Backend : 
  - planification : shouldnt be able to select heat (unless very rare case where you can play nothing) => moved to back, as front makes _private.cards selectable, and heat is in the least (player colored heat at least)
  - should we send cellId for React and other questions to move cars ? So I can highlight the cell like I just did for Speed state.
  - make last card of a discard notif always visible ?
  - when using Refresh reaction, skip other reaction. And make sure there is no mandatory reaction pending.
  - skip salvage (with logs) if empty discard

Frontend :
  - react : heated boost with weather that makes it no longer heated !
  
  - championship: new field received in getAllDatas
    'index' => represents which circuits we are playing in the list of circuit
    'event' => id of the event card (following sprite in img/) 
      => you have the names of events around line 400 in Notifications.php and also the relevant information about events in constants.inc.php
      => display a press icon on the correct corner

  - handle UI when circuitDatas are empty for custom championships and custom tracks

  - refresh : display the name of the card (only if several refresh ?) => maybe with the same formatting as accelerate
  - for accelerate/refresh => make the card clickable ?

  - test the end of the draft phase (hand cleaned & refilled ?)
  - salvage state
  
  - make speed counter work => updates when notif reveal, with sum of cards.speed. I need to check what can change this counter, probably reacts ? Maybe clean it at notif clearPlayedCards ?

  - move car animation : => a reaaaaaally cool plus would be to have the log entries hoverable and you would get the path drawing display on hover (like the white path I had on my little animation test)

  - user pref : voir seulement le haut des cartes en main => garder environ 1/6 de la hauteur et mettre le plateau joueur par dessus, permet d'avoir une vue globale plus complÃ¨te

  - zoom icons are gone => No they are just under the map, as the map now autoscale like in TTR

  - find a font simir to BetterFaster-Italic for card text
