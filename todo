GUY :

- react : 189351: "Issues with Draft/Cooldown in the React step" => issue with "gear" entry of cooldown probably.
- undo : "undo here" is not always clickable, need refresh
- undo : make undo buttons a bit separate on the right with some margin (I think it's actually in the new guidelines)
- I think this one should never actually happen if backend send "used" correctly: remove "boost" button on title bar and on cards, it should always be automatically resolved when revealed

- chooseSpeed: handle cases when player have the choice on how to achieve a given speed.
  => use debug newReact. Select brakes 1/2/3/4 and brakes 1/4 for instance.
  => speed 5 can be either achieved by doing 1 + 4 or 4 + 1 and the user should be able to choose
  => you should always skip this choice phase if only one choice is possible
  => you should probably always auto select the first choice and just let the user change the choice if they want to before hitting confirm, since it's a very niche situation

TIM :

- check undo on some action + add some timing for turn confirmation (currently autoskip discard + auto spin-out)
- check "not enough heat to play" code
