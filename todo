Other :
  - Cluttered hand: waiting for an answer from DoW about that.
    How can we compute "valid cards to play" ? Should we take into account the cooldown the the car may get if it lands in a sector with a weather token ?
    Can a player make a bet using stress by hoping to land in such sector ?
    
Backend :
 - Cluttered hand: set gear to 1

Frontend :
 - rethink inPLay deck position. place it where ithe market is? Or Force it to 1 line only ? Remove stress card when they are resolved ?
  - planification : highlight already selected cards (also on refresh), you have a parameter in the args :       
      'selection' => $planification[$pId] ?? null,

  - upload form: only allow .heat files

  - refresh : display the name of the card (only if several refresh ?) => maybe with the same formatting as accelerate
  - for accelerate/refresh => make the card clickable ?
  
  - move car animation : => a reaaaaaally cool plus would be to have the log entries hoverable and you would get the path drawing display on hover (like the white path I had on my little animation test)

  - user pref : voir seulement le haut des cartes en main => garder environ 1/6 de la hauteur et mettre le plateau joueur par dessus, permet d'avoir une vue globale plus complÃ¨te

  - zoom icons are gone => No they are just under the map, as the map now autoscale like in TTR
