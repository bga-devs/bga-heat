GUY :

- 1965 events custom notification : eventRemoveHeat
- add undo
- for upTo, only send necessary entries (when having 2 reduce symbols and 2 + cards, if I click one, currently I can't use the second one after)
- new podium shapes

TIM :

- recode the React phase
- handle double agressive legend!
- add undo
- make "+" cards used again when playing them (playing 4 and "+", it only resolves 4), instead of sending them in React

MISC:

- handle different podium shapes : include podium shape into circuit's data + allow for adhoc placement for extra podium slot for base circuits
  => reconstruct rectangles in frontend with matching font ?
