Other :

Backend : 
  - planification : shouldnt be able to select heat (unless very rare case where you can play nothing) => moved to back, as front makes _private.cards selectable, and heat is in the least (player colored heat at least)
  - should we send cellId for React and other questions to move cars ? So I can highlight the cell like I just did for Speed state.
  - pass when no react, or only useless cooldown ? I think I would let it visible when there is still a cooldown action, even if useless.
  - make last card of a discard notif always visible ?

Frontend :
  - test the end of the draft phase (hand cleaned & refilled ?)

  - notifications are too fast
  
  - make speed counter work => updates when notif reveal, with sum of cards.speed. I need to check what can change this counter, probably reacts ? Maybe clean it at notif clearPlayedCards ?

  - move car animation : => a reaaaaaally cool plus would be to have the log entries hoverable and you would get the path drawing display on hover (like the white path I had on my little animation test)

  - user pref : voir seulement le haut des cartes en main => garder environ 1/6 de la hauteur et mettre le plateau joueur par dessus, permet d'avoir une vue globale plus complÃ¨te

  - zoom icons are gone => No they are just under the map, as the map now autoscale like in TTR

  - find a font simir to BetterFaster-Italic for card text
