Other :

Backend :
  
  - planification : shouldnt be able to select heat (unless very rare case where you can play nothing) => moved to back, as front makes _private.cards selectable, and heat is in the least (player colored heat at least)
  - should we send cellId for React and other questions to move cars ? So I can highlight the cell like I just did for Speed state.
  - check my answer in Frontend to merge payHeats notifs

Frontend :
  - payHeatsForCorner notif
  - payHeats notif (for heated boost for instance)
   => maybe these two notifs can be merged ? Unless you want to add a red circle around the corner for instance for the payHeatsForCorner notif ? that could be cool
   => it can be merged if you want, with an optional "corner" attribute if we want to highlight it
  - spinOut notif
   => also very similar but also contains the new cell and the additional stress cards drawn

  - place -X carCell for other maps (USA coordinates : 0: { x: 376, y: 82, a: 0 },)

  - scrapCards notif: flipping card from deck to discard

  - "reduce stress" icon for React
  - discard notif : public discard if 'cards' is set up, eg for "reduce stress" effect the stress cards are public
    => now that I am thinking about it, maybe the last card when discarding should also be public to update discard display, no ?

  - tooltips for upgrades

  - display discard
  - display number of cards left in deck
  
  - make speed counter work => updates when notif reveal, with sum of cards.speed. I need to check what can change this counter, probably reacts ? Maybe clean it at notif clearPlayedCards ?

  - move car animation : => a reaaaaaally cool plus would be to have the log entries hoverable and you would get the path drawing display on hover (like the white path I had on my little animation test)

  - user pref : voir seulement le haut des cartes en main => garder environ 1/6 de la hauteur et mettre le plateau joueur par dessus, permet d'avoir une vue globale plus complÃ¨te

  - zoom icons are gone => No they are just under the map, as the map now autoscale like in TTR

  - add ignore flag on public notif for drawing cards

  - find a font simir to BetterFaster-Italic for card text
