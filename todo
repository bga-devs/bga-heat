Other :
 - finish to extract circuit datas


Backend :
  
  - planification : shouldnt be able to select heat (unless very rare case where you can play nothing) => moved to back, as front makes _private.cards selectable, and heat is in the least (player colored heat at least)
  - should we send cellId for React and other questions to move cars ? So I can highlight the cell like I just did for Speed state.
  - updateTurnOrder notif : send constructor ids (by order of play ? or with an associated "no") instead of just constructor_names. I tried to add `constructor_ids` as an array, as I think it's sorted. Is it OK ?

Frontend :
  - payHeatsForCorner notif

  - reveal : handle when args.heat != null

  - display discard
  - display number of cards left in deck ??
